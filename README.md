# UW-Data-558-Spring-2018

This repository includes the final polished code release of my own implementation of a Logistic Regression model for UW DATA 558 Statistical Machine Learning in Spring 2018. This repository contains demo notebooks which assess the performance of my algorithm with both real and simulated datasets. The results computed with the algorithm are also compared to the results from Logistic Regression function from the sklearn package. 

The repository is organized as follows:

 * Demo 1 - Implementation of Logistic Regression model using Spam dataset
 * Demo 2 - Implementation of Logistic Regression model using a simulated dataset
 * Demo 3 - Comparision of my Logistic Regression model with Sklearn functions
 * src/LogisticRegression.py - Annotated source codeModule used in demo notebooks with annotated code

The demo notebooks can be operated by cloning the repository onto your local machine. The notebooks will automatically import the functions specified in the LogisticRegression.py file. The demo notebook and accompanying py module were developed in Python 3.6. Depending on prior installations, it contains dependencies on the following packages:

* pandas
* numpy
* sklearn
* matplotlib
